### About the project

<p> Developed during the third year of Technical High School, Stigma is a personal diary app where users can write about their day, respond to motivational prompts, take on challenges, and read messages tailored to their emotions. User actions reflect in the emotional graph, dynamically changing based on the emotions shared.</p>

### Administration

<p> A simple website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase. Authorized administrators can add questions, challenges, and phrases that will be sent to users through the app.</p>

### Built with

<blockquote>
Kotlin - programming language.<br>
XML - used to quickly design UI layouts and intrinsic screen elements.<br>
Firebase - a Google digital platform used to facilitate the development of web or mobile applications.<br>
</blockquote>
